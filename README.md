Overview:
FitFlex is a gym management system designed exclusively for Admin users. The application enables the Admin to manage various aspects of a gym, including users, trainers, classes, bookings, and memberships. Admin users can view, edit, delete, and manage all data related to users, trainers, and gym operations. The system is built using Laravel, Bootstrap for the front end, and MySQL for the database. Non-admin users, such as trainers and members, do not have access to any of the admin functionalities.




Features:
Admin Dashboard: Admin users have access to a comprehensive dashboard with full control over the gym management system.

User Management: Admins can manage users (add, edit, delete), view user details, and assign roles (e.g., Admin, Trainer, Member).

Trainer Management: Admins can manage trainer profiles, including their names, specialties, and contact details.

Class Management: Admins can view and manage gym classes, including class details, trainer assignments, start times, and available spots.

Booking Management: Admins can oversee and manage class bookings, ensuring that classes are fully booked or available for registration.

Membership Management: Admins can manage gym memberships, view membership types, start and end dates, and the users who are subscribed to each plan.
